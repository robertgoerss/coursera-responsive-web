# coursera-responsive-web

This repository contains my coursework and coding assignments for the Responsive Web Development and Design specialization certificate program offered through Coursera by Goldsmiths, University of London, England.

Coursework is often scratched together for the purposes of proof-of-concept and may pay little attention to cohesive design, code beauty, functionality or any number of other desirable traits in software development.

Assignments tend to be more polished.
