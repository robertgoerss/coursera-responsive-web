				In the interests of including an ordered-list in this submission, here are 2 x 2 informational entries:

				<ol>
					<li>
						I am 33 years old, married and have two children. I live in New Hampshire, USA near Portsmouth, which is on the Atlantic seacoast in the Northeast.
					</li>
					<li>
						I made my first website as a personal homepage on AOL in the mid-90's. It was a fan page for the industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails. It had GIFs of a fireball exploding, which I used as bookends for the section headers. That made my homepage mostly the best one on AOL.
					</li>
					<li>
						New Hampshire is a wicked awesome place for pine tree enthusiasts.
					</li>
					<li>
						This is my first Coursera enrollment.
					</li>
					<li>
						Thirty-three years ago it was 1984. <span class="eighty4">:) lol&lt;ol&gt;</span>
